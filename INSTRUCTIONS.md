find bugs and fix them in <https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader>

## Guidelines

- Do NOT edit src/config.rs - this file contains custom configuration and should be left untouched
- Focus on fixing bugs and improving code quality in other files
- Add tests when fixing bugs to prevent regressions
- Keep changes small and focused
