# Nautilus Trader Autopatcher - New Features

## Overview

The Nautilus Trader Autopatcher has been enhanced with two major new capabilities:

1. **Self-Improvement**: The autopatcher can analyze and improve its own codebase
2. **Automatic Pull Request Creation**: Create PRs against the target repository

## Features

### 1. Self-Improvement

The autopatcher can now analyze its own codebase for improvements and automatically apply them.

**How it works:**

- Every 5th iteration (configurable), the autopatcher analyzes its own source code
- Uses DeepSeek AI to identify potential improvements in code quality, structure, performance, etc.
- Automatically applies improvements, commits, and pushes changes
- Restarts itself after self-improvement to ensure the new code is running

**Configuration:**

```bash
export ENABLE_SELF_IMPROVEMENT=true    # Enable/disable self-improvement (default: true)
export SELF_IMPROVEMENT_FREQUENCY=5    # Check every N iterations (default: 5)
```

### 2. Automatic Pull Request Creation

The autopatcher can create pull requests against the target repository when it identifies significant pattern violations or improvements.

**How it works:**

- Analyzes the target repository for pattern violations based on INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Creates pull requests with detailed descriptions when issues are found
- Currently implemented as a placeholder (GitHub API integration in progress)

**Configuration:**

```bash
export ENABLE_AUTO_PR=true                                    # Enable/disable auto PR creation (default: true)
export TARGET_REPO_URL="https://github.com/nicolad/nautilus_trader"  # Target repository (default)
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"                      # Required for PR creation
```

## Outcome Types

The autopatcher now supports different outcomes based on its analysis:

### AutopatcherOutcome::SelfImprove

- Triggered when the autopatcher finds improvements in its own code
- Automatically applies the improvements and restarts the process
- Commits with `[self-improve]` tag

### AutopatcherOutcome::CreatePullRequest  

- Triggered when significant pattern violations are found in the target repository
- Creates a detailed pull request with the proposed fixes
- Includes rationale and description of the changes

## Implementation Details

### Self-Improvement Process

1. Analyzes autopatcher source files (`src/main.rs`, `src/config.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
2. Uses AI to identify specific improvements needed
3. Generates a patch with the improvements
4. Applies the patch to the autopatcher's own codebase
5. Tests compilation with `cargo check`
6. Commits and pushes the changes
7. Restarts the autopatcher process

### PR Creation Process (Planned)

1. Analyzes target repository for pattern violations
2. Identifies specific issues that warrant a pull request
3. Creates a branch with the fixes
4. Applies the patch to the branch
5. Creates a pull request with detailed description

## Configuration Structure

New configuration sections added:

```rust
pub struct GitHubConfig {
    pub token: Option<String>,                    // GitHub token for API access
    pub target_repo_url: String,                  // Target repository URL
    pub enable_self_improvement: bool,            // Enable self-improvement
    pub enable_auto_pr: bool,                     // Enable auto PR creation
    pub self_improvement_frequency: usize,        // How often to check for self-improvements
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub personal access token | Required for PR creation |
| `TARGET_REPO_URL` | Target repository URL | `https://github.com/nicolad/nautilus_trader` |
| `ENABLE_SELF_IMPROVEMENT` | Enable self-improvement | `true` |
| `ENABLE_AUTO_PR` | Enable auto PR creation | `true` |
| `SELF_IMPROVEMENT_FREQUENCY` | Check every N iterations | `5` |

## Usage

1. Set the required environment variables
2. Run the autopatcher as usual
3. The autopatcher will automatically:
   - Check for self-improvements every 5 iterations
   - Create PRs when significant issues are found
   - Continue with normal pattern analysis and fixing

## Example Output

```
üîÑ === Iteration 5/10 ===
üéØ Checking for special autopatcher outcomes...
üîç Analyzing autopatcher codebase for self-improvements...
üîß Self-improvement triggered: Improve error handling in config validation
üîÑ Applying self-improvement patch: Improve autopatcher error handling
üß™ Testing that self-improvements compile...
üìù Committing self-improvement...
üì§ Pushing self-improvement...
üéâ Self-improvement applied and pushed successfully!
üîÑ Restarting after self-improvement...
```

## Future Enhancements

- Complete GitHub API integration for PR creation
- Support for more complex patch types in PR creation
- Integration with code review workflows
- Automated testing of self-improvements before applying
- Rollback capability for failed self-improvements
