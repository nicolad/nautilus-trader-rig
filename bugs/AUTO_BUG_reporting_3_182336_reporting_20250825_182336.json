  "description": "The `format_number` function has a critical integer overflow vulnerability. When converting from f64 to u64, if the input value is negative, the rounding operation will produce a large positive number due to two's complement representation. For financial applications, this could lead to completely incorrect reporting of block numbers, rates, and progress percentages. A negative input (which shouldn't occur in this context but could result from calculation errors) would be interpreted as an extremely large positive number.",
