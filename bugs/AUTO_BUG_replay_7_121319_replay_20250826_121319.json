The code uses `HashMap::remove()` when flushing data to disk, but immediately continues processing new messages that get added to new collections. If the system crashes or encounters errors during file writing, the data that was removed from memory maps will be permanently lost without any recovery mechanism. This is particularly critical for financial data where data integrity is paramount.",
