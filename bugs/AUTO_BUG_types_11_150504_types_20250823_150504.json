  "description": "The `DatabentoImbalance` struct uses `c_char` type for `significant_imbalance` field which is a platform-dependent type (i8 or u8). This can lead to portability issues and incorrect interpretation of the value when crossing platform boundaries. In financial contexts, incorrect interpretation of market data flags could lead to trading errors or miscalculations.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Use a well-defined integer type with explicit signedness that matches the expected data format from Databento (likely i8 or u8). For example: `pub significant_imbalance: i8` if the value is expected to be signed, or `pub significant_imbalance: u8` if unsigned.",
