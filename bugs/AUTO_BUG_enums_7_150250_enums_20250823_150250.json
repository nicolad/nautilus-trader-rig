  "description": "The `Exchange::from_venue_str` method contains a critical logic error in the bidirectional mapping between venues and exchanges. The method returns a vector of exchanges for a given venue string, but the implementation has inconsistent mappings that break the bidirectional relationship. Specifically, when converting back from exchange to venue string using `as_venue_str()`, some exchanges map to different venue strings than what was used to retrieve them, breaking the expected symmetry.",
