  "code_sample": "See file content",
  "description": "The code contains a critical memory safety issue where `OrderBookDelta` values are being copied and pushed into a buffer using `*delta` dereference, but the `OrderBookDelta` type appears to be a complex structure that should not be copied via dereferencing. This could lead to incorrect financial data processing, memory corruption, or undefined behavior. Additionally, the hard-coded price precision value of 2 is a financial calculation error that could cause significant monetary losses due to incorrect price calculations.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Replace blocking operations with async-compatible alternatives using `tokio::time::sleep` and proper async synchronization primitives, or restructure to avoid blocking in the async context.",
