  "description": "The code contains several potential issues including improper validation of input URLs, potential for denial of service through unlimited vector sizes, and lack of validation for critical financial parameters. The `http_rpc_url` and `wss_rpc_url` parameters are accepted as strings without validation, which could lead to injection attacks if these URLs are used to construct requests. The `dex_ids` vector has no size limits, which could lead to resource exhaustion. The `from_block` parameter lacks validation to ensure it represents a valid block number. Additionally, the use of `Option<u32>` for `rpc_requests_per_second` without a sensible default or validation could lead to performance issues or unintended rate limiting behavior.",
