  "description": "Validated Pattern Issues: [R041] as numeric cast (confidence: 0.85); [R116] float->int as (confidence: 0.85); [R041] as numeric cast (confidence: 0.85); [R116] float->int as (confidence: 0.80); DeepSeek: The `format_number` function has a potential panic vulnerability when converting large f64 values to u64. If the input value exceeds u64::MAX (approximately 1.8e19) or is negative, the conversion will panic. This could be exploited by an attacker providing malicious input data to cause a denial of service. Additionally, there's precision loss when converting f64 to u64 for large numbers due to floating-point representation limitations.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Add input validation to handle edge cases: check if the value is within u64 range (0 to u64::MAX) and handle negative numbers appropriately. Consider using checked conversions or returning a Result instead of panicking.",
