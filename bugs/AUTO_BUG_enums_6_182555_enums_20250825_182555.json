  "description": "The `from_venue_str` function has incomplete mapping logic that could lead to incorrect exchange identification. Several exchange variants are missing from the mapping table, including `BinanceUs`, `HuobiDmSwap`, and others. This could cause financial trading systems to misidentify exchanges, potentially leading to incorrect market data processing or order routing.",

  "fix_suggestion": "Complete the mapping table to include all exchange variants. Consider using a more maintainable approach such as a static HashMap or implementing a derive-based solution to ensure all enum variants are properly mapped. Add comprehensive tests to verify all exchange variants can be correctly mapped from venue strings.",
