  "code_sample": "See file content",
  "description": "The code contains a potential path traversal vulnerability in the `new()` method. When no publishers_filepath is provided, it constructs a path relative to the current executable directory by popping the executable path and appending \"publishers.json\". This could allow an attacker to manipulate the current working directory or executable path to load arbitrary JSON files from the filesystem, potentially leading to malicious code execution or information disclosure if the loaded JSON is used in unsafe ways.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Validate the constructed path to ensure it's within an expected directory, or require an explicit path to be provided. Consider using a hardcoded relative path or environment variable instead of deriving from the current executable path.",
