  "description": "The code contains a potential integer overflow vulnerability in the `format_number` function. When converting a negative f64 value to u64, the behavior is undefined and may result in unexpected large values due to two's complement wrapping. This could lead to incorrect formatting, memory allocation issues, or panics when processing negative numbers. Additionally, the function doesn't handle NaN or infinity values properly.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Add proper input validation and handle edge cases:",
