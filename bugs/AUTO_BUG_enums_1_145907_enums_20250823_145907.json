  "description": "The `From<nautilus_model::enums::OrderSide> for Side` implementation contains a panic that could crash the entire application during order processing. This is a critical reliability issue in a trading system where unexpected order sides could lead to system crashes and potential financial losses. The panic occurs when encountering an unexpected `OrderSide` variant, which should be handled gracefully instead of crashing.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Replace the panic with proper error handling. Use a `Result` return type or implement a fallback/default behavior. For example:",
