  "description": "The code has a critical memory safety issue with the use of `Rc<RefCell<T>>` pattern in a potentially multi-threaded context. The `create` method accepts `_cache: Rc<RefCell<Cache>>` and `_clock: Rc<RefCell<dyn Clock>>` parameters, but `Rc` is not thread-safe (it doesn't implement `Send` or `Sync`). If this factory is used in a multi-threaded environment (which is highly likely for a trading system), this will cause runtime panics or undefined behavior when these objects are accessed across thread boundaries.",
  "fix_suggestion": "Replace `Rc<RefCell<T>>` with `Arc<Mutex<T>>` or `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for thread-safe interior mutability. The fix should be applied to both the function signature and all call sites:",
