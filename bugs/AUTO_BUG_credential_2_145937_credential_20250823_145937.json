  "description": "The code stores API secret as a Vec<u8> in memory without any protection. This exposes sensitive credentials to potential memory scraping attacks, process memory dumps, or side-channel attacks. The secret remains in memory indefinitely and could be accessed through debug interfaces or memory inspection tools. For financial trading systems, this represents a critical security vulnerability as compromised API keys could lead to unauthorized trading and significant financial losses.",
